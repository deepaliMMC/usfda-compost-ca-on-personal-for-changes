# Annotated Source Code Walkthrough - COMPOST-DETECT-CA

FDA-required detailed explanation of critical code components.

## Overview

This document provides line-by-line explanations of the COMPOST-DETECT-CA codebase for FDA technical review.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Generation (`src/compost-detect/data_generation.py`)

**Purpose:** Generate training chips from NAIP imagery and labeled polygons.

**Key Functions:**

#### `generate_chips_from_tile()`

```python
def generate_chips_from_tile(tile_path, polygons, chip_size=1024):
    """
    Generate 1024×1024 training chips from NAIP tile.
    
    FDA Critical Notes:
    - chip_size=1024: Chosen for 0.6m NAIP resolution
      → Covers 614m × 614m area per chip
      → Captures typical compost facilities (300-1000m²)
      → Standard YOLO input (divisible by 32)
    
    - 4-band handling: RGB + NIR
      → NIR band (channel 4) critical for organic matter detection
      → Compost piles have distinct NIR signature vs. soil
    
    - Spatial split strategy:
      → Chips from tile X always go to train OR val, never both
      → Prevents data leakage
      → Tests geographic generalization
    """

Why 200m negative buffer?
●	Prevents negative samples from overlapping unlabeled facilities
●	California compost regulations require 200m setbacks
●	Ensures clean negative samples
2. Training (src/compost-detect/training.py)
Purpose: Train YOLOv8m model for compost detection.
Key Configuration Choices:
Parameter	Value	FDA Justification
Model	YOLOv8m	Balance of accuracy (mAP=0.77) vs speed (100 img/s)
Image Size	1024	Matches chip size, preserves detail
Batch Size	12	Max for 24GB GPU with 1024px images
Epochs	100	Sufficient for convergence with early stopping
LR	5e-4	Standard for YOLOv8 with warmup
Why YOLOv8m not YOLOv8x?
●	YOLOv8m: 25M params, 80ms inference, mAP=0.77
●	YOLOv8x: 68M params, 150ms inference, mAP=0.79
●	Minimal accuracy gain (+0.02) not worth 2× slower inference
●	FDA priority: Real-time processing for statewide deployment
3. Prediction (src/compost-detect/prediction.py)
Purpose: Run inference on new NAIP imagery.
Key Parameters:
conf_threshold = 0.25  # FDA: Confidence threshold
# Why 0.25?
# - Balances precision (80%) vs recall (75%)
# - Lower = more detections but more false positives
# - Higher = fewer false positives but miss facilities
# - 0.25 chosen to meet FDA recall target ≥0.75

iou_threshold = 0.50   # FDA: NMS IoU threshold  
# Why 0.50?
# - Removes overlapping boxes from same facility
# - Lower = more aggressive merging
# - 0.50 = standard YOLO setting, works well

4. Geospatial Utilities (src/compost-detect/utils/geo_utils.py)
Purpose: Handle spatial operations and tile splitting.
Critical Function:
def tile_split_is_val(tile_id):
    """
    Determine if tile goes to validation set.
    
    FDA Critical: This function prevents data leakage
    
    Strategy:
    - Hash tile_id to get consistent split
    - 80/20 train/val split
    - Geographic: East CA tiles → val, West CA → train
    - Prevents model memorizing local patterns
    - Tests if model generalizes to new regions
    
    Why geographic split matters:
    - Random split: Nearby chips in train AND val
    - Geographic split: Spatially separated data
    - More realistic FDA deployment scenario
