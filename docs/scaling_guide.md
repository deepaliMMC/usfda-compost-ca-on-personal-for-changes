# Scaling Guide - Multi-State Deployment

FDA guidance for deploying COMPOST-DETECT-CA to additional states.

## Overview

Three deployment strategies:
1. **Zero-Shot**: Use California model as-is (fastest, 70-80% performance)
2. **Few-Shot Fine-Tuning**: Collect 200-500 facilities, fine-tune (recommended, 90-95% performance)
3. **Full Retraining**: Collect 1000+ facilities, train from scratch (best, matches California performance)

## Strategy 1: Zero-Shot Deployment

**Use Case:** Quick assessment, limited budget

**Steps:**
1. Use trained California model without modification
2. Run inference on new state's NAIP imagery
3. Evaluate performance on sample of facilities

**Expected Performance:** 70-80% of California performance
- CA mAP: 0.77
- New state mAP: 0.55-0.62 (estimated)

**When to Use:**
- Quick feasibility study
- Budget <$5,000
- Timeline <1 week

## Strategy 2: Few-Shot Fine-Tuning (Recommended)

**Use Case:** Production deployment, moderate budget

**Data Requirements:**
- Minimum: 200 facilities (30-40 per facility type)
- Recommended: 500 facilities (80-100 per type)
- Geographic diversity across state

**Steps:**

### Step 1: Collect State-Specific Data (2-4 weeks)

```bash
# Prepare annotation files for new state
# Format same as California:
# - compost_polygons_texas.geojson
# - neg_points_texas.geojson

Step 2: Generate Training Chips (1-2 days)
# Update configs/default.yaml for new state
BUCKET: "objectdetction-tx"
NAIP_PREFIX: "NAIP_Imagery_2024_Texas/"
POS_GEOJSON: "compost_polygons_texas.geojson"
NEG_GEOJSON: "neg_points_texas.geojson"

# Generate chips
python src/compost-detect/data_generation.py

Step 3: Fine-Tune Model (4-8 hours)
# Fine-tuning script (modify training.py)
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load California model
model = YOLO('runs/detect/california_yolov8m_4ch/weights/best.pt')

# Fine-tune on Texas data
model.train(
    data='data/texas_yolo_4band_v1/dataset.yaml',
    epochs=30,  # Fewer epochs for fine-tuning
    lr0=0.0001,  # Lower learning rate
    freeze=10  # Freeze first 10 layers initially
)

Step 4: Validate Performance
python scripts/benchmark_model.py \
  --model runs/detect/texas_yolov8m_4ch/weights/best.pt \
  --data data/texas_yolo_4band_v1/dataset.yaml

Expected Performance: 90-95% of California performance
●	CA mAP: 0.77
●	TX mAP: 0.69-0.73 (with 500 facilities)
Cost Estimate:
●	Annotation: $5,000-$10,000
●	AWS training: $100-$200
●	Validation: $2,000-$5,000
●	Total: $7,100-$15,200
Strategy 3: Full Retraining
Use Case: Best performance, large budget
Data Requirements:
●	Minimum: 1,000 facilities
●	Recommended: 2,000+ facilities
Steps: Same as California training (see reproducibility_guide.md)
Expected Performance: Matches California (mAP ~0.77)
Cost Estimate: $50,000-$100,000
State-Specific Considerations
State	Dominant Facility Types	NAIP Availability	Recommendation
Texas	Beef, Dairy	Good	Few-shot
Florida	Poultry, Dairy	Good	Few-shot
Iowa	Swine, Beef	Good	Zero-shot or Few-shot
Washington	Dairy, Poultry	Good	Few-shot
Oregon	Dairy, Beef	Good	Few-shot
Factors Affecting Performance:
●	Climate: Humid states (FL) vs dry states (CA) affect vegetation
●	Facility design: Enclosed buildings (IA swine) vs open piles (CA)
●	NAIP quality: Resolution (0.6m vs 1.0m) affects detection
Deployment Checklist
●	[ ] Select appropriate strategy (zero-shot / few-shot / full)
●	[ ] Obtain NAIP imagery for new state
●	[ ] Collect and annotate training data (if fine-tuning)
●	[ ] Verify data structure with verify_data_structure.py
●	[ ] Train or fine-tune model
●	[ ] Validate performance with benchmark_model.py
●	[ ] Deploy if FDA targets met
